This example showed how to use:
1) friend class;
2) template;

friend class:
When you want to access to a private variable in a class A (say "Node" in the
example) from another class B (say "Stack"), you need to add class B as a
friend class in class A's definition: see the code on line 25.

In addition, you may need to declare class B before class A (like the code on
line 5), so class A can recoginze class B.

template:
When template is added into class B, it might be a little bit complex.
For example, when you declare class B at line 5, you need to add the template
before the declaration, see the code on line 4.

Meanwhile, you need to add
the template type with <> for the friend class declaration, see the code on
line 25:
"friend class Stack" -> "friend class Stack<Data>"
